# Crystal Reports vs WebI Reports in SAP BusinessObjects

## 🌐 First, what are these?

Both **Crystal Reports** and **Web Intelligence (WebI)** are **reporting tools** in the BusinessObjects suite,  
but they are designed for different purposes.

---

## 🔹 Crystal Reports

- **Pixel-perfect reporting tool**.  
- Best for **highly formatted, detailed, printed reports**.  
- Fixed layout → every column/line is exact.  
- Great for **invoices, payslips, financial statements**.  
- Requires **developer skills** to design (not as flexible for end users).  
- Usually scheduled → not interactive for casual users.  

👉 Example: You want to generate **monthly bank statements** → Crystal Reports is the best.

## 🔹 WebI (Web Intelligence)

- **Ad-hoc analysis and interactive reporting tool**.  
- Web-based, business users can build reports themselves.  
- Drag-and-drop interface, less technical.  
- Best for **interactive dashboards, summaries, self-service BI**.  
- Allows filtering, drilling, slicing, and dicing data on the fly.  
- Not pixel-perfect → layout is flexible, but not for invoices.  

👉 Example: A **sales manager** wants to check sales by region, product, and drill down to customers → WebI is the best.
