## ðŸ”‘ Key Points about SAP NetWeaver

1. **Integration Platform** â€“ It connects SAP with non-SAP systems (Java, .NET, etc.) and enables communication between different applications.
   
2. **Technology Stack** â€“ Built mainly on **ABAP** (SAPâ€™s programming language) and **Java**.  
   - ABAP stack runs traditional SAP apps.  
   - Java stack runs web-based apps and portals.

3. **Middleware Role** â€“ Supports:  
   - Application integration  
   - Data exchange  
   - Business process management  
   - User interfaces (e.g., SAP Portal)  

4. **Components** (examples):  
   - **SAP NetWeaver Application Server (AS ABAP/AS Java)** â€“ Core runtime environment.  
   - **SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (BW)** â€“ Data warehousing and reporting.  
   - **SAP NetWeaver Portal** â€“ Single point of access for enterprise apps.  
   - **SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (PI/PO)** â€“ Middleware for connecting SAP â†” Non-SAP.  

5. **Why Important** â€“ Before **SAP S/4HANA**, most SAP applications were built and run on **NetWeaver**. Even today, some legacy systems and middleware use it.
