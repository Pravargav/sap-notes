Excellent 👌 You’re now asking at the **transaction level** — let’s place **MM01 / MM02** properly in the SAP structure.

  

## **1. What are MM01 and MM02?**

 

 

- **MM01** → Transaction code to **create a material master**.

 

- **MM02** → Transaction code to **change a material master**.

 

- (MM03 is for display).

 



 

A **material master** is the core record for anything a company buys, makes, stores, or sells (raw materials, finished products, services, etc.).

  

## **2. Where do they exist in SAP?**

 

🔹 **Layer → Application Layer**

 

 

- **Module → MM (Materials Management)**

 

- **Sub-process → Master Data Management**

 



 





 

👉 Example navigation in Easy Access:

 `SAP Easy Access   
 → Logistics     
 → Materials Management      
 → Material Master          
 → Material   
 
 → Create (Special)  → MM01     
 
 → Change           → MM02      
 
 → Display          → MM03 `
 

 



 

 




  

## **4. Analogy**

 

Think of **MM01/MM02** as the “Add/Edit Product” screens in an e-commerce admin panel.

 

 

- The product you create (material master) will later be used in orders, stock management, and financials.

 



  

✅ So final placement:

 

 

- **MM01/MM02 = T-codes inside SAP GUI (Easy Access) → Application Layer → MM Module → Material Master Data
