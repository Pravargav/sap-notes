*What SAP Activate Is*

SAP Activate =3D
*SAP Best Practices* + *Guided Configuration* + *Agile Delivery Methodology=
*

It is designed to make SAP deployments *faster, flexible, and iterative*
rather than the long, rigid timelines of the old *ASAP Waterfall* method.

------------------------------
*Why Agile Is the Foundation*

   - *Short Iterations (Sprints)* instead of long phases
   - *Daily Stand-ups* for rapid issue resolution
   - *Backlog Management* to prioritize features and configurations
   - *Continuous Testing* rather than one big test at the end
   - *Early Feedback* via working prototypes

------------------------------

Phase Agile Connection What Happens

*Discover* Pre-Project Vision Understand business needs, select deployment
(Cloud, On-Premise, Hybrid)

*Prepare* Sprint 0 / Setup Build team, plan roadmap, provision systems

*Explore* Fit-to-Standard Workshops Compare SAP Best Practices to business
needs, refine backlog

*Realize* Iterative Sprints Configure, test, adjust in multiple cycles

*Deploy* Release Sprint Final cutover, user readiness, go-live

*Run* Agile Continuous Improvement Monitor, optimize, and enhance post
go-live

------------------------------
*Key Agile Features in Activate*

   - *Fit-to-Standard* =E2=86=92 Start with SAP=E2=80=99s ready-to-use proc=
esses and adapt
