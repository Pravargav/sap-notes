In **SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)**, the concepts of **Dimensions** and **Measures** are central to how data is modeled and analyzed. Here’s the clear difference:

  

### 🔹 **Dimension**

 

 

- **Definition**: Qualitative (descriptive) fields used to categorize, group, or filter data.

 

- **Nature**: Textual or categorical values.

 

- **Purpose**: They provide context to the numbers.

 

- **Examples**: 

 

  - Customer Name

 

  - Product ID

 

  - Region

 

  - Date/Time

 



 

 



 

👉 Think of them as the **“by what”** you are analyzing the data. (e.g., *Sales by Region*, *Profit by Product*).

  

### 🔹 **Measure**

 

 

- **Definition**: Quantitative fields that contain numerical values you can aggregate.

 

- **Nature**: Numeric, can be summed, averaged, min/max, etc.

 

- **Purpose**: They represent the values you want to analyze.

 

- **Examples**: 

 

  - Revenue

 

  - Quantity Sold

 

  - Profit Margin

 

  - Costs

 



 

 



 

👉 Think of them as the **“what numbers”** you want to analyze. (e.g., *Total Sales*, *Average Profit*).

  

### 📊 **Example in SAC**

 

If you build a chart:

 

 

- **Dimensions**: *Region*, *Product Category*, *Month*

 

- **Measures**: *Sales Revenue*, *Units Sold*

 



 

So, you might create a visualization like: ➡️ "Total **Sales Revenue (measure)** by **Region (dimension)**."

  

✅ **In short:**

 

 

- **Dimension = descriptive data (who, what, when, where).**

 

- **Measure = numeric data (how much, how many).**
