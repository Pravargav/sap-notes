## SAP Activate methodology

The SAP Activate methodology is SAP’s official framework for implementing SAP solutions, and it’s explicitly built on Agile methodology but tailored for SAP projects.

What SAP Activate Is

SAP Activate =
SAP Best Practices + Guided Configuration + Agile Delivery Methodology

It is designed to make SAP deployments faster, flexible, and iterative rather than the long, rigid timelines of the old ASAP Waterfall method.

-----------------------------
Why Agile Is the Foundation

Short Iterations (Sprints) instead of long phases

Daily Stand-ups for rapid issue resolution

Backlog Management to prioritize features and configurations

Continuous Testing rather than one big test at the end

Early Feedback via working prototypes

----------------------------
The Six Phases of SAP Activate

# Phase	-> Agile Connection |	What Happens

Discover -> 	Pre-Project Vision	| Understand business needs, select deployment (Cloud, On-Premise, Hybrid)

Prepare	-> Sprint 0 / Setup	 | Build team, plan roadmap, provision systems

Explore ->	Fit-to-Standard Workshops |	Compare SAP Best Practices to business needs, refine backlog

Realize ->	Iterative Sprints	| Configure, test, adjust in multiple cycles

Deploy ->	Release Sprint	| Final cutover, user readiness, go-live

Run	-> Agile Continuous Improvement |	Monitor, optimize, and enhance post go-live

----------------------------
Key Agile Features in Activate

Fit-to-Standard → Start with SAP’s ready-to-use processes and adapt only where needed.

Incremental Delivery → Deploy usable pieces early, not all at once.

Collaborative Teamwork → End users, business SMEs, and IT work together continuously.

Transparency → Backlogs, burn-down charts, and demo reviews keep progress visible.

If you want, I can give you a side-by-side comparison of SAP Activate vs. pure Agile Scrum so you see exactly how SAP adjusted Agile to fit ERP implementations.
