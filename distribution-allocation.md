| Feature | Distribution | Allocation |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**| Splitting an amount **equally or proportionally** across target members. | Shifting an amount from one set of members to another based on a **driver** or rule. |
| **Direction** | One → Many (break down a single value into multiple parts). | Many → Many or One → Many (reassign values based on logic). |
| **Driver** | Can be **equal share** or based on **proportion** (e.g., percentages). | Usually based on **business rules, drivers, or reference data**. |
| **Use Case** | Distribute total *Sales Forecast* of 100,000 across 12 months → 8,333 each. | Allocate *Overhead Costs* from HQ to departments based on headcount or revenue share. |
| **Focus** | Spreading values. | Reassigning costs/revenues logically. |
| **Example** | Enter 120,000 for year → distribute evenly into 10,000 per month. | Allocate 1M IT costs from *Corporate* entity to *Regions* using employee count as driver. |
