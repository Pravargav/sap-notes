Great question 👌 Let’s make this very clear and simple.
  
## 📊 1. **Standard SAP Reports**
 
 
- **What it is:** Pre-delivered reports that come **built-in with SAP**.
 
- **Who makes it:** Provided by SAP itself.
 
- **Customization:** Little or no customization.
 
- **Example:** A standard sales order report (VA05 – List of Sales Orders).
 
- **Use case:** When your requirement is common and already covered by SAP.
 

 
👉 Think of it like **buying a ready-made shirt** – you just pick and wear it.
  
## 📊 2. **Custom Reports**
 
 
- **What it is:** Reports that are **specially developed** (using ABAP, CDS views, or SAP tools) to meet a company’s **unique requirements**.
 
- **Who makes it:** SAP consultants/developers.
 
- **Customization:** Fully flexible (you define what data, fields, layout, etc.).
 
- **Example:** A report that shows “Top 10 customers by region with special discount history” (not available in standard SAP).
 
- **Use case:** When the standard SAP report doesn’t meet your business need.
 

 
👉 Think of it like a **tailor-made shirt** – designed just for you.
  
## 📊 3. **Ad-hoc Reports**
 
 
- **What it is:** Reports created **on the fly by business users** using reporting tools (like SAP BW, SAP BO, WebI, or SAC).
 
- **Who makes it:** Business analysts or power users (no need to code).
 
- **Customization:** Flexible → user picks fields, filters, and layout.
 
- **Example:** A manager quickly creates a report showing “Today’s sales by region” in SAC or WebI.
 
- **Use case:** When you need **quick insights** or **temporary one-time analysis**.
 

 
👉 Think of it like **mix-and-match dressing** – you choose and style it yourself whenever needed.

Good question 👍
 
The answer is: **Yes, custom reports *can* contain charts and graphs — but only if they are designed that way.**
  
### 📌 How it works:
 
 
**Custom Reports (ABAP, CDS Views, ALV reports, etc.)**
 
 
  - By default, many custom reports are **tabular (rows & columns)**.
 
  - But if the developer uses **ALV with Graphical Display, Fiori Elements, or SAP Analytics tools**, they can add **charts, graphs, and dashboards**.
