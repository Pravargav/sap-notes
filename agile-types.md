# Agile Model Overview

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes **flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress**. Work is divided into small cycles called **sprints**, allowing quick feedback and adjustments.

## **Types of Agile Methodology with Examples**

1. **Kanban**
   - **Concept:** Visual board to manage tasks ("just in time")  
   - **How it works:** Tasks are moved across columns like "To Do → In Progress → Done"  
   - **Example:** A team uses Trello to track software bugs, moving cards across columns as progress is made.

2. **Scrum**
   - **Concept:** Work divided into fixed-length sprints (usually 2–4 weeks)  
   - **How it works:** Teams hold daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews  
   - **Example:** An e-commerce website team develops new features in 2-week sprints, reviewing progress at the end of each sprint.

3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**
   - **Concept:** Focuses on teamwork, continuous feedback, and frequent releases  
   - **How it works:** Developers write tests first (TDD), pair programming, and short iterations  
   - **Example:** A fintech startup releases small updates every week while constantly testing and improving code.

4. **Crystal**
   - **Concept:** Lightweight methodology emphasizing people, communication, and flexibility  
   - **How it works:** Less documentation, more focus on interactions and quick delivery  
   - **Example:** A small startup building a mobile app prioritizes user feedback and adapts design quickly with minimal formal process.

5. **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
   - **Concept:** Structured agile approach with defined phases and scalable processes  
   - **How it works:** Clear plan, regular delivery, and adjustments based on progress  
   - **Example:** A large enterprise develops a payroll system using DSDM to ensure all departments are coordinated and deadlines are met.
